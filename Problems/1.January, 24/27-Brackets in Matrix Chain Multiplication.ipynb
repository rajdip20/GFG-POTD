    "Given an array **p[]** of length **n** used to denote the dimensions of a series of **matrices** such that the dimension of **i'th** matrix is **p[i] * p[i+1]**. There are a total of **n-1** matrices. Find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in [**MCM**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/matrix-chain-multiplication-dp-8/), you were returning the most effective count but this time return the **string** which is formed of **A - Z** (only Uppercase) denoting matrices & **Brackets**( **\"(\" \")\"** ) denoting multiplication symbols. For example, if n =11, the matrixes can be denoted as A - K as n<=26 & brackets as multiplication symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:**\n",
    "1. Each multiplication is denoted by putting **open & closed** brackets to the matrices multiplied & also Please note that the order of matrix multiplication matters, as matrix multiplication is non-commutative **A * B != B * A**\n",
    "2. As there can be **multiple** possible answers, the console would print \"**True**\" for the **correct** string and \"**False**\" for the **incorrect** string. You need to only return a **string** that performs a minimum number of multiplications.\n",
