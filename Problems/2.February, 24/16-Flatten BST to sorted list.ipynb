    "You are given a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** with **n** nodes, each node has a distinct value assigned to it. The goal is to flatten the tree such that, the **left child** of each element points to nothing **(NULL)**, and the **right child** points to the next element in the sorted list of elements of the **BST** (look at the examples for clarity). You must accomplish this **without using any extra storage**, except for recursive calls, which are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If your **BST** does have a **left child**, then the system will print a **-1** and will skip it, resulting in an **incorrect solution**.\n",
