    "Given a **m * n** grid with each cell consisting of **positive**, **negative**, or **zero** point. We can move across a cell only if we have positive points. Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points, the task is to find **minimum initial points** to reach cell **(m-1, n-1)** from **(0, 0)** by following these certain set of rules :\n",
