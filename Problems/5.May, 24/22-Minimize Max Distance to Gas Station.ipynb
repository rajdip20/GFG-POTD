    "We have a horizontal number line. On that number line, we have gas **stations** at positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where **n** = size of the stations array. Now, we add **k** more gas stations so that **d**, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized. We have to find the smallest possible value of d. Find the answer **exactly** to 2 decimal places.\n",
