    "You are given a weighted undirected graph having **n** vertices numbered from **1 to n** and **m** edges along with their weights. Find the **shortest path** between the vertex 1 and the vertex **n**,  if there exists a path, and return a list of integers whose first element is the **weight** of the path, and the rest consist of the nodes on that path. If no path exists, then return a list containing a single element **-1**.\n",
