    "You are given a special linked list where each node has a next pointer pointing to its next node. You are also given some random pointers, where you will be given some pairs denoting two nodes **a** and **b** i.e. a->random = b (**random** is a pointer to a random node).\n",

Second line tells us the value of four nodes. The third line gives the information about arbitrary pointers. The first node arbitrary pointer is set to node 2.  The second node arbitrary pointer is set to node 4.\n",
